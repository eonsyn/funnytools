          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Dowry has existed in various cultures for centuries. Traditionally, it was intended as a form of financial security for the bride as she transitioned into her new household. Over time, however, this practice has evolved into a deeply problematic social norm, often leading to the commodification of women and imposing significant financial pressure on families with daughters.

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            In an effort to combat this issue, the Government of India enacted the <span className="font-medium text-black">Dowry Prohibition Act of 1961</span>. This law officially makes the giving and receiving of dowry a punishable offense. According to the act, dowry is defined as any property or valuable assets exchanged between the parties before, during, or after marriage. Despite being outlawed, the practice still persists in various forms across different regions.

            In recent years, growing numbers of young couples and progressive families are standing against dowry. Movements promoting gender equality and women’s rights have sparked nationwide awareness campaigns. These initiatives encourage marriages based on mutual respect, consent, and equality — rather than transactional traditions.
